### Hi there! I'm Dylan ðŸ‘‹

I am a graduate of Wenatchee Valley College, where I studied Math, Business Communication, and English. While attending, I was a recurring member of the Dean's List, an active member of the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, and graduated with a 3.7 GPA. Although I had never taken a credited CS class in college, I began learning Python in my spare time so I could write apps that streamlined my mathemetics courses. 

In 2019, I began work as a real estate broker. While working as a broker, I examined ways to apply my programming background to my day-to-day tasks. Most notably, this includes writing software that automates many of the repeatable processes of a running a real estate business, such as CRM, marketing, and transaction coordination.

In 2021, I began learning full-stack web development via The Odin Project. The Odin Project is a self-paced, free open source coding curriculum. As an experiential learner, The Odin Project has been immensely valuable in providing a path and building a portfolio. The majority of repos here are from The Odin Project's curriculum, while many of my personal apps are hosted privately.
