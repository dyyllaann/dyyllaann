### Hi there! I'm Dylan ðŸ‘‹

My first exposure to web development was teaching myself basic HTML at 12 years old. Since then, I've created dozens of websites and apps that make my life easier. I had always considered programming a hobby and had never seriously pursued it. Now, 20 years later, it's time to turn what I love doing into a career. 

I am a graduate of Wenatchee Valley College, where I studied Math, Business Communication, and English. While attending, I was a recurring member of the Dean's List, an active member of the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, and graduated with a 3.7 GPA. Although I had never taken a credited CS class in college, I began learning Python in my spare time so I could write apps that streamlined my mathemetics courses. 

In 2019, I began work as a real estate broker. While working as a broker, I examined ways to apply my programming background to my day-to-day tasks. Most notably, this includes writing software that automates many of the repeatable processes of a running a real estate business, such as CRM, marketing, and transaction coordination.

In 2021, I began learning full-stack web development via The Odin Project. The Odin Project is a self-paced, free open source coding curriculum. As an experiential learner, The Odin Project has been immensely valuable in providing a path and building a portfolio. The majority of repos here are from The Odin Project's curriculum, while many of my personal apps are hosted privately. 

At this stage (April 2022), I've developed two React apps, and I've begun learning backend with MongoDB and Express.

My main interests are automation, PropTech, and data. My dream job would be a development role at a PropTech or SaaS company that values creative, collaborative input, that employs my multidisciplinary background, and that makes a positive difference in people's lives.
